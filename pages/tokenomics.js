          <p className="mt-2">
            The $ANKY token's total supply, inspired by the golden ratio, is
            161,803,398,874,989. This unique approach to token supply is a
            testament to our commitment to integrating natural principles and
            harmony into the world of blockchain.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Sojourn-Based Release Cycles</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Each sojourn cycle, lasting 117 days, sees the release of 10% of the
            total token supply. This cycle is designed to mimic the natural
            rhythms of growth and renewal, fostering a sustainable and long-term
            approach to token distribution.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Community-Driven Pricing</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The pricing of $ANKY tokens for each sojourn cycle is democratically
            decided by the Anky community. This unique method allows token
            holders to have a direct impact on the valuation, reflecting the
            collective sentiment and engagement of the community.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            For instance, if the community deems the project's growth and
            development to have increased its value, they may vote for a higher
            valuation in the subsequent sojourn cycle.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold">Staking and Long-Term Rewards</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Holders who stake their $ANKY tokens are rewarded not just for the
            quantity staked but also for the duration of the stake. This
            mechanism is designed to reward long-term holders and contributors,
            aligning with our vision of community-driven growth and stability.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            As an example, staking for longer periods may yield higher returns,
            encouraging a stable and engaged token holder base.

          <p className="mt-2">
            Looking ahead, $ANKY aims to be more than a token; it's a foundation
            for a network of interconnected local economies. Through the
            creation of local tokens linked to $ANKY, we envision a vibrant
            ecosystem where global and local initiatives mutually thrive.
